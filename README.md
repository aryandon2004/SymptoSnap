SymptoSnap – Visual Symptom Analyzer
SymptoSnap is an AI-powered mobile + web application that enables users to identify visible symptoms such as skin rashes, swelling, or eye redness using image classification. It provides possible condition predictions, risk assessment, and medical guidance — empowering early diagnosis and reducing delays in seeking care.
